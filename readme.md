This is a microframework for the 0xBUTT app.  It includes only the initial/blank setup with all dependencies and components setup. The IDE of choice was Eclipse under Linux. The setup will be edited with each change. It is important to keep a blank and a starting-point before adding any actual code. The framework of a choice is called "Ninja Framework". Reason for using Ninja is simply because it gets things done.
